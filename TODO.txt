- make a set of components :

  * form set: inputs, buttons, checkboxes...
  * skinning system & examples
  * repeater
  
 
- The connectors could have just one instance for the all document ( or could be static classes) ?

- norm the data consumer / data provider components ?

  for both consumers and providers : a typedef defining the detail parameter of the CustomEvent
  
  for providers :
	  a dispatch data method

- make a timer and a playbar component

- with the use of macro, force having a static override var className when extending DisplayObject ?




Things to discuss :
	
	- this heritage system is not perfect : if we want a component which will be both data provider, data consumer, ... it's not possible => propose a composition system ? or a metadata / macro based system ? or simulate multi inheritance with "using" ?
	
	- the dynamically generated ids are not a good idea ? What if we want to add manually an id ?
